# ADK-TS Compliance Report

## ✅ Project Status: FULLY COMPLIANT

This project has been completely restructured to be **100% compliant** with ADK-TS standards and best practices.

## 🏗️ Structural Changes Made

### 1. Agent Architecture ✅
- **Before**: Mixed agent patterns, redundant files
- **After**: Clean ADK-TS LlmAgent hierarchy
  - `orchestrator.ts` - Main orchestrator agent
  - `workflow-analyzer.ts` - Specialized analysis agent
  - `workflow-builder.ts` - Specialized creation agent
  - `workflow-optimizer.ts` - Specialized optimization agent
  - `workflow-validator.ts` - Specialized validation agent
  - `index.ts` - Proper ADK-TS exports

### 2. Tool Integration ✅
- **Before**: Basic FunctionTool usage without context
- **After**: Full ADK-TS ToolContext integration
  - All tools use `ToolContext` parameter
  - Memory search and storage capabilities
  - State management integration
  - Artifact storage and retrieval
  - Zod schema validation
  - Comprehensive error handling

### 3. MCP Server Integration ✅
- **Before**: Separate MCP servers not integrated with ADK-TS
- **After**: MCP servers as ADK-TS tools
  - `mcpTools.ts` - ADK-TS compliant MCP integration
  - Context-aware MCP calls
  - Artifact logging of MCP interactions
  - State management for MCP operations

### 4. Service Integration ✅
- **Before**: No ADK-TS services
- **After**: Full ADK-TS service integration
  - `InMemorySessionService` for session management
  - `InMemoryMemoryService` for knowledge storage
  - `InMemoryArtifactService` for file management
  - All agents configured with services

### 5. Evaluation Framework ✅
- **Before**: No evaluation setup
- **After**: Complete ADK-TS evaluation framework
  - `evaluation/tests/` - Test case definitions
  - `evaluation/test_config.json` - Evaluation configuration
  - `evaluation/run_evaluation.ts` - Evaluation runner
  - `pnpm test:eval` - Evaluation script

### 6. Main Entry Point ✅
- **Before**: Basic demo script
- **After**: ADK-TS compliant main entry
  - Proper agent instantiation
  - Service integration
  - Session management
  - Error handling
